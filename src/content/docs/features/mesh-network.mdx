## Overview

The mesh network distributes task execution across multiple devices with automatic load balancing, health monitoring, and failover. Each device in the mesh operates independently while coordinating through a shared task queue.

## Device Registration

Each mesh device registers itself with:

```typescript
interface MeshDevice {
  id: string;
  hostname: string;
  status: "online" | "offline" | "busy";
  availableModels: string[];
  currentLoad: number;
  maxConcurrent: number;
  lastHeartbeat: Date;
}
```

## Load Balancing

The mesh coordinator assigns tasks based on:

1. **Device load** — percentage of max concurrent tasks in use
2. **Model availability** — does the device have the required model?
3. **Latency** — network distance to the coordinator
4. **Health score** — recent success rate and response times

## Health Monitoring

Devices send heartbeat signals every 30 seconds. If a device misses 3 consecutive heartbeats, it's marked offline and no new tasks are routed to it.

Active tasks on a failed device are automatically reassigned to healthy devices.

## Scaling

- **Starter** — single device (your primary machine)
- **Professional** — up to 3 devices in the mesh
- **Enterprise** — unlimited devices

Adding a new device to the mesh takes under 5 minutes — install the agent, configure the API keys, and it auto-registers with the coordinator.

## Mesh Status

You can check mesh status at any time:

```
/mesh status

Mesh Status:
  device-1: online (load: 23%, tasks: 2/8)
  device-2: online (load: 67%, tasks: 5/8)
  device-3: offline (last seen: 2m ago)

Active tasks: 7
Queued tasks: 3
```

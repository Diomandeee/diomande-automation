## Overview

Pulse sessions are autonomous development loops where the AI executes multi-iteration workflows without human intervention. Each iteration builds on the previous one, with the system self-correcting and adapting based on results.

## How It Works

A Pulse session:

1. Takes a high-level objective
2. Plans an execution strategy
3. Executes the first iteration
4. Evaluates results against the objective
5. Plans the next iteration based on what was learned
6. Repeats until the objective is met or max iterations reached

## Starting a Pulse Session

```
/pulse Build a complete user authentication system with login, signup, password reset, and session management
```

The system will:

- Plan the implementation across multiple iterations
- Execute each step autonomously
- Report progress after each iteration
- Deliver the final result when complete

## Session Management

- `/pulse status` — check current session progress
- `/pulse pause` — pause an active session
- `/pulse resume` — resume a paused session
- `/pulse abort` — stop a session immediately

## Use Cases

Pulse sessions are ideal for:

- **Feature development** — building complete features from scratch
- **Refactoring projects** — large-scale code restructuring
- **Documentation** — generating comprehensive docs
- **Test suites** — building tests for existing code

## Availability

Pulse sessions are available on the **Enterprise** tier. They require dedicated mesh device capacity since sessions may run for extended periods.

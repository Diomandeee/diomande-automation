## Overview

Team decomposition takes a complex task and automatically splits it into independent subtasks that can be executed in parallel across multiple AI agents. After all subtasks complete, the results are synthesized into a coherent final output.

## How It Works

When you submit a team task:

```
/team Build a REST API with authentication, CRUD operations, and tests
```

The system:

1. **Analyzes** the task to identify independent subtasks
2. **Decomposes** into parallel work units
3. **Assigns** each subtask to an AI agent with the optimal model
4. **Executes** all subtasks in parallel
5. **Synthesizes** results into a unified output

## Example Decomposition

```
Task: "Build a REST API with auth, CRUD, and tests"

Subtask 1: Database schema and models [Claude]
Subtask 2: Authentication middleware [Claude]
Subtask 3: CRUD endpoints [Gemini]
Subtask 4: Test suite [Claude]

Execution: parallel
Synthesis: merge all outputs into complete API
```

## Synthesis

After all subtasks complete, the synthesis step:

- Resolves any conflicts between subtask outputs
- Ensures consistency across all generated code
- Merges results into a unified deliverable
- Reports the complete result with per-subtask timing

## When to Use Team Tasks

Team decomposition is most effective for:

- **Multi-file projects** — building features that span multiple files
- **Full-stack features** — frontend + backend + tests in one request
- **Documentation projects** — multiple doc pages generated in parallel
- **Refactoring tasks** — consistent changes across many files

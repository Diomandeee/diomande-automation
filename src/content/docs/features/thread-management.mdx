## Overview

Every task gets its own dedicated thread with full lifecycle management. This prevents channel pollution, keeps task context isolated, and enables clean archival of completed work.

## Thread Lifecycle

Threads transition through three states:

```
ACTIVE → IDLE → ARCHIVED
```

- **ACTIVE** — task is being processed, results are streaming
- **IDLE** — task is complete, thread remains accessible
- **ARCHIVED** — thread is archived after the idle timeout

## Lifecycle Configuration

Default thresholds (configurable per client):

- **Active → Idle** — automatic when task execution completes
- **Idle → Archived** — 24 hours of no activity
- **Unarchive** — any new message in the thread reactivates it

## Thread Naming

Threads are named with a consistent format:

```
task-{short-id} | {model} | {status}
```

Example: `task-a3f7bc21 | Claude | Complete`

## Channel Routing

Different Discord channels can be mapped to different configurations:

- `#engineering` → code tasks, Claude model, high priority
- `#content` → writing tasks, Claude model, normal priority
- `#quick` → simple tasks, fastest model, low priority

## Benefits

- **No channel pollution** — every task is contained in its own thread
- **Full context** — the entire task conversation lives in one place
- **Clean history** — archived threads don't clutter active channels
- **Easy retrieval** — search threads by task ID or content

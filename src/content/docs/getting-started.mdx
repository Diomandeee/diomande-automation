## Prerequisites

Before deploying your Claw bot instance, you'll need:

- A Discord server (or we'll create one for you)
- A Stripe account for billing (we'll set this up together)
- Your team's preferred communication channels identified

## Deployment Process

### 1. Initial Consultation

We start with a 30-minute call to understand your workflows. We'll cover:

- What tasks your team currently handles manually
- Which gateways your team uses (Discord, Slack, API, etc.)
- How many devices you'll need in your mesh network
- Which AI models are best suited for your use cases

### 2. Infrastructure Setup

Based on your consultation, we deploy:

- Your dedicated Claw bot instance
- Gateway connections (Discord bot, API endpoints, etc.)
- Mesh device enrollment and health monitoring
- Model routing configuration

### 3. Guided Onboarding

We walk you through:

- Discord server setup — creating channels, inviting the bot, setting permissions
- Gateway configuration — connecting your preferred interfaces
- Mesh device enrollment — adding machines to your network
- Channel routing — mapping channels to projects and models
- Test run — executing a test task to verify setup

### 4. Go Live

Once your test run succeeds, you're live. Your team can start submitting tasks immediately through any configured gateway.

## Your First Task

After setup, try submitting a simple task through Discord:

```
/task Write a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence
```

You'll see the task classified, routed to the optimal model, and executed — with the result delivered right back in your thread.

## Next Steps

- Read about **Task Dispatch** to understand how tasks flow through the system
- Learn about **Team Decomposition** for complex multi-part tasks
- Explore **Model Routing** to understand automatic model selection

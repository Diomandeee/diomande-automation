## What is Diomande Automation?

Diomande Automation deploys a production-grade AI task execution platform — **Claw bot** — for your team. It's a distributed system that accepts tasks through multiple gateways (Discord, API, SMS, Telegram), classifies them, routes them to the optimal AI model, executes them across a mesh network of devices, and delivers results back to your team.

This isn't a wrapper around an API. It's a full execution platform with multi-agent decomposition, intelligent model routing, thread lifecycle management, and a knowledge system with 112K+ turns of context.

## What You Get

- **Multi-gateway access** — submit tasks through Discord, REST API, SMS, or Telegram
- **Intelligent task routing** — automatic model selection based on task classification
- **Team decomposition** — complex tasks split into parallel subtasks across agents
- **Distributed execution** — run across multiple devices with load balancing
- **Thread management** — every task gets its own isolated execution context
- **Knowledge system** — semantic search and context recovery across sessions

## How It Works

1. You send a task through any gateway (Discord command, API call, etc.)
2. The task is classified by type, complexity, and required capabilities
3. The system selects the optimal AI model (Claude, Gemini, Codex)
4. For complex tasks, it decomposes into parallel subtasks
5. Tasks are distributed across available mesh devices
6. Results are synthesized and delivered back through the original gateway

## Quick Start

1. **Book a consultation** — we'll discuss your use case and recommend a tier
2. **Setup** — we deploy your Claw bot instance with your preferred gateways
3. **Onboarding** — guided setup of Discord server, mesh devices, and model preferences
4. **Test run** — verify everything works with a test task
5. **Go live** — start automating your team's workflows

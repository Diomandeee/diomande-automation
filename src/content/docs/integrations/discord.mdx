## Overview

Discord is the primary gateway for most Claw bot deployments. The bot joins your server, listens for commands, creates threads for task execution, and delivers results in real-time.

## Setup

### 1. Create a Discord Server

If you don't have one, create a Discord server for your team. We recommend dedicated channels for different task types.

### 2. Bot Invitation

We'll provide a bot invitation link during onboarding. The bot requires these permissions:

- Send Messages
- Create Public Threads
- Send Messages in Threads
- Manage Threads
- Read Message History
- Use Slash Commands

### 3. Channel Configuration

Map channels to task configurations:

```
#engineering → model: claude, priority: high
#content     → model: claude, priority: normal
#quick       → model: gemini, priority: low
```

## Commands

### Task Commands

- `/task <content>` — submit a single task
- `/team <content>` — submit for multi-agent decomposition
- `/pulse <content>` — start an autonomous session

### Management Commands

- `/status` — check bot status and mesh health
- `/threads` — list active threads
- `/history` — recent task history

## Thread Behavior

Every task creates a new thread in the channel where it was submitted. The thread contains:

- The original task content
- Execution status updates
- The final result
- Timing information

Threads auto-archive after 24 hours of inactivity.

## Rate Limits

The bot respects Discord's rate limits automatically. If you're submitting many tasks in rapid succession, they'll be queued and processed in order.

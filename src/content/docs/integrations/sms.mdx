## Overview

The SMS gateway allows task submission via text message. Send a text to your dedicated number, and receive results back as SMS.

## Setup

During onboarding, we provision a dedicated phone number for your Claw bot instance via Twilio. Your team members can submit tasks by texting this number.

## Usage

Text any task to your Claw bot number:

```
Generate a cron expression that runs every weekday at 9am EST
```

Results are sent back as SMS replies. For longer results, the response includes a link to the full output.

## Limitations

- SMS has a 1600-character limit per message
- Long results include a link to the full output
- Team decomposition is not supported via SMS
- Binary content (code files, images) delivered via link

## Availability

SMS is available on **Professional** and **Enterprise** tiers.

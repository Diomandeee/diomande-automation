## Overview

The Telegram gateway lets you submit tasks through a Telegram bot. Send messages directly to the bot, and receive results in the same chat.

## Setup

During onboarding, we'll create a Telegram bot for your instance and provide the bot username. Add it to your team's group chat or use it via direct message.

## Usage

Send any message to the bot to submit a task:

```
Write a SQL query that finds duplicate emails in the users table
```

For team tasks, prefix with `team:`:

```
team: Build a login page with form validation and error handling
```

## Supported Features

- Single task submission
- Team task decomposition
- Task status checking
- Result delivery with formatting

## Availability

Telegram is available on **Professional** and **Enterprise** tiers.
